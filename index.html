        <h1>Hi. Lydia's online.</h1>
        <p>I know... "What an ugly ass page!", "The hell is this font??", "Such bad tastes!".</p>
        <p>It's been a long time. Uh? For some, maybe, for some others... mhm... Do they even care?</p>
        <p>It's about time I leave the Internet. I recently experienced a surge of... disappointment towards certain peoples and how I'm treated towards them online. Reconnaissance has also been something that took a punch in the gut pretty hard. And it's not about being selfish, it's about being fake towards others. That's what I'm pointing out. a***c, please be better, you're not perfect. You know you've broken a few's people heart knowingly, you and your friends.</p>
        <p>But that ain't really my point... pointing people out and all... I try to remain neutral... But seriously... You've done more wrong than good, so obviously at some point I *can* take a position. I took mine...</p>

        <p>Shitting the bed apart, I'm gone. A few people won't ever see me again online. They might believe they will for a few reasons, which I believe they are right to have a thought for, but I'm real. You won't see me.</p>
        <p>I'm taking a break! That's it! Goodbye Internet, you've been clogging me for years and it's time to flush it all.</p>
        
        <p>Someone pointed out that this might be received as a <i style="text-decoration: underline;">complete final</i> goodbye message. No, it isn't, I promise. I'm enjoying life like never ever before, and it just ROCK! I finally got a job, stuff to experience some more, a more free myself (since, well, I'm leaving), many more friends than before, and all and all...</p>
        <p>so no, no bad ending on my end! I take those last words with a great happiness! I'm leaving and I'm happy about it! That's just how things are sometime. Quite like leaving your position of CEO.</p>
        
        <p>Sssssoooooo... I've only kept contact with two... (ok, maybe three) persons I'm very close to, but there are MANY people I've left behind... So for the sake of thanking the most impactful people I've met online, here's your quote you deserve for being a good influence on me.</p>
        <p>There are no preference in the order given, it's ordered alphabetically:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>aikaterna (You're an immense source of inspiration to me. I want to become someone like you, maybe if you're not perfect, you're exactly who I wish I was. We both have to learn stuff, I'm sure)</li>
            <li>Archee (Such good and silly time on THE FINALS, would play again)</li>
            <li>Axas (ALTER EGO SUPREMACY FOREVER!)</li>
            <li>Blue (We had such good memories over our beers in DRG)</li>
            <li>Cat (My favorite femboy friend. Thank for supporting me in my today's goal and being such a wonderful person)</li>
            <li>coco (Such a nice concert with the Frenchies. You're a good friend, wish you could teach me some more on stuff. Don't worry, school 'n work got that covered)</li>
            <li>Darius (How's you guys doing? Maybe you should drop me a letter some days, feel free to request my address in the email below or on my Discord profile, I'd love keeping contact over letters with you, it's something I hold close to my heart: to write)</li>
            <li>Doctor Fourier (you're the most chaotic friend I got and I like it :v)</li>
            <li>Draper (I'm still surprised how easily you accepted me in your life, most especially considering how difficult it is to be friend with you. You helped me tons in time where I needed much help to become a better person. You're truly an awesome friend I've had)</li>
            <li>epic guy (You're a good person after all? :) you indirectly taught me how to be nice in moments I was angry for no reasons)</li>
            <li>Fixator10 (Favorite dev. You helped me much in my programming beginning. Thank to your previous work, I have a job I am enjoying so much. Which isn't programming. Much love and luck to you in your country, I hope things won't go to shit later on)</li>
            <li>Glas (fucking weeb...)</li>
            <li>Internet Alien (You introduced me to an amazing group of person I loved playing with, AND THAT'S RARE AS HELL. Would do it again 10/10. Hope you enjoyed the french taste of my accent)</li>
            <li>June (ofc you're quoted here)</li>
            <li>L9 Tanguy (you're one of my first friends I got and hold close to. Too bad we lost contact over time... fucking weeb)</li>
            <li>MAX (I feel like I owe you much. Thank for being one of my best friend on Red, I had so much fun with you. I still don't mind how introverted you were back when we meet, it was still fun! You're one of the person I'm the saddest to leave behind. I'm sorry my friend. I hope we'll meet again however.)</li>
            <li>Mike Kohn, Ab, devin, joe, simer, and the rest I probably can't quote (A year of Telnet of communication over a terminal (Yep, almost!), and yet we only know not so much about ourselves, considering how unregularly connected I was. All shame on me, I agree! It still has been an amazing experience to meet you guys and taste how things used to be! Thank you millions of time)</li>
            <li>Mimka (come on... Ask it and drop me that letter :v)</li>
            <li>moniker (Let's meet soon!)</li>
            <li>Nocty (ALTER EGO SUPREMACY FOREVER!)</li>
            <li>pheeno (I hope you'll make Soran a good success one day! Keep on rocking, I'll keep listening to your awesome music)</li>
            <li>Thusuzzee (We hated each others to finally become the best friends. We probably have the most interesting back story about our relationship...)</li>
            <li>topi (you're a funny guy! too bad we hadn't the chance to meet earlier, I would have loved to shit with you some more)</li>
            <li>TwinShadow (fucking weeb... BUT... you have good taste! so you're excused >:D)</li>
            <li>WildAdmiral (Okay so now... I have absolutely NO IDEA how you ended up being a friend... But I totally won't complain about it lmao. Also one of the most interesting friendships I've ever had)</li>
            <li>Xyleff (Oh brother... your happiness, your joy, your energy make you an amazing person. I wish we could know each others some more, like IRL friends... But welp, that's life. At least I'm SO GLAD we got to meet at least once ^^)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That's a hell of a list.</p>
        <p>Welp. No better time than now for me to take the door and wish everyone a good 'ol goodbye!</p>

        <p>If you wish, you can leave a message at <b>leaveamessage.flattered362@passmail.com</b>. I most likely won't answer back, but if you got anything to share, that's how it can go through.</p>

        <p>Those are my very final last words. It's... my last words..? How odd... How weird it feels... To know you're leaving for a better future. Fact that I know I won't come back only half kill me.</p>
